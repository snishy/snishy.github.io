# Snishy
Snishy is an email client add-on that integrates into users webmail, desktop and mobile clients to verify the authenticity of email sources by tagging their corresponding emails with Snishy’s checkmark badge. 

It considers the email sender as verified if its name and email address match a record in Snishy’s crowdsourced distributed ledger (DL) of verified email sources. It aims to help email users prevent phishing attacks made through fake email messages by gradually changing their mindset from being a trust any source to trust only verified sources.

In social media you add a contact to start mutual communication if you know the person (I.e. Facebook, Linkedin, Instagram, etc.), but in email, you frequently open an email from unknown sources. It is almost impossible to reinvent the actual email system and protocols but we can change the user mindset.
